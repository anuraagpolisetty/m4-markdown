# Exercise-2

As described in [chapter-5](https://info201-s17.github.io/book/introduction-to-git-and-github.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

`git commit -m "_Description_"`

The command `git commit -m "Updated description of learned command"` commits this README.md file to the repository and includes a message.

  *Commits changes in all files from the staging area to the repository
  *Includes a message with "-m"
    *Describes changes being made
  *Creates a snapshot you can return to
